# 👋 Hi there, I'm Salvo!

I'm a developer and Computer Science graduate who loves turning ideas into software. I'm passionate about:
- 🎮 Video games – both playing and understanding what makes them tick  
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
- 💻 Software Development – building cool, useful, and elegant things

I’m always exploring new tech, learning by doing, and having fun along the way.

Thanks for stopping by!
